************************************************************************
CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS between TYPO3 4.4 and 4.5
(for technical details see ChangeLog)
************************************************************************

General
=======

	* 4.5 will be the first official TYPO3 release with LTS (long term support)
	* A Sprite Generator was added. This allows you to create your own
	  sprite files, also core can generate the files if some new icons
	  were added (#15079).
	* When TYPO3 runs with two different domain names for the FE and the
	  BE, it is now possible to set accordingly different cookie domains
	  using $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['FE']['cookieDomain'] and
	  $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['BE']['cookieDomain'].
	* Pages of type "Shortcut" can now also link to the parent page, not
	  only to the first or a random subpage.
	* The media element now has a core wizard for rewriting URLs. This
	  allows the user to copy the URL from browser (eg a youtube URL like
	  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkA9qw80xO0) and use
	  it in the media element as URL. Currently supported platforms:
	  youtube, dailymotion, sevenload, vimeo, clipfish, google,
	  metacafe, myvideo, liveleak and veoh.



Backend
=======

	* The frameset was removed. This makes the Backend a lot faster. 
          Now the navigation tree also can be resized. The new backend works
          using the ExtJS viewport, providing an easy and unified interface
          to manipulate the content of the different panels.
	* The user can decide the type of each page created in the
	  "Create multiple pages" Wizard. And the wizard can create more
	  than 9 pages at once.
	* All system extensions from typo3/mod were moved to real system
	  extensions. These modules are:
		- Extension Manager
		- List module
		- Filelist module
		- Info module
		- Access module
		- Workspace module
	  List module and Extension Manager are set to required extensions,
	  but it is possible to overwrite this setting in localconf.php eg
	  if you want to deinstall the Extension Manger. Make sure you visit
	  the Update Wizard!!!
	* The recycler was refactored and has now the same skin as the rest
	  of the BE.
	* DB check -> page tree submodule was removed (module lowlevel).
	* RSA Auth now works also with special chars.
	* Clearing cache now is logged (#15305).
	* A hook now allows postprocessing of filelist and TCEforms files
	  operations (#15192 and #15221). Typical use-case:
	  - Allow editors to upload any picture (e.g., 10 Mpixels) as they
	    don't know how to resize the pictures or do not have the software
	  - Prevent fileadmin to be overflooded with huge pictures which
	    will never be used in their original size
	  - Automatically resize "huge" pictures after the upload
	  Extension using it already:
	  http://forge.typo3.org/projects/show/extension-image_autoresize
	* New TS config option to disable the "Show secondary options"
	  checkbox (#13797). In User-TS, you can set:
	  options.enableShowPalettes=0 to see this feature in action.
	  Default is still "1" like it used to be.


Frontend
========

	* FE login now allows to show the logout form direct after login.


Extbase / Fluid
===============

	* Fixed Extbase Caching Bug.
	* All methods trying to find an object by uid now ignore the
	  storagePid. This changes the behavior of argument mapping and the
	  way extbase fetches 1:1 relations. Resolves #5631. You should not
	  experience any negative side-effects of this change, i.e. if your
	  extension worked before, it will definitely after this change.
	  However, it makes the record handling more robust.
	* Performance improvements in
	  TypoScript::convertTypoScriptArrayToPlainArray.
	* Fluid contains many new features you might want to start using.
	  There are some changes that require special attention in case you
	  created custom condition ViewHelpers or if you call renderSection()
	  and renderWithLayout() from Tx_Fluid_View_TemplateView.
	* Check out these ChangeLogs for more details:
	  - typo3/sysext/extbase/ChangeLog.txt
	  - typo3/sysext/fluid/ChangeLog.txt


Compatibility
=============

	* See typo3/sysext/fluid/ChangeLog.txt for some breaking changes in
	  Fluid.
	* See typo3/sysext/extbase/ChangeLog.txt for a fix that might break
	  certain setups (caching bug fixed, might break extbase extensions
	  that setup their own TS configuration manually)
	* The API for registering additional cache frontends or backends has changed.
	  As of TYPO3 4.5 only the classname needs to be specified in favor of both
	  path to the php file and the classname. Instead the class needs to be
	  registered for autoloading. See #15586 for details.
	  Example:
	  New:
	  $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SYS']['caching']['cacheFrontends']['myext']='tx_myext_cache';
	  Old:
	  $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SYS']['caching']['cacheFrontends']['myext']='/path/tx_myext_cache.php:tx_myext_cache';


Development
===========

	* There is a new setting that shows all SQL queries in debug
	  (#15425): $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SYS']['sqlDebug'] = 2;
	* Contrib libraries can be replaced now via hook (#15218). This
	  allows to test with updates of these libraries. Demo extensions
	  can be found here:
		http://forge.typo3.org/projects/typo3v45-projects/files
	* Catch all ExtDirect Exceptions and show them in the DebugConsole.
	  It now also allows you to call debug() (#15513).
	* DebugConsole now also catch console-calls from Javascript if no
	  console is available. This allows eg debug prints in browsers
	  having no console like the IE
	* ExtDirect is available in the frontend now (#15754):
	  http://wiki.typo3.org/ExtDirect

TypoScript
==========

	* stdWrap now has a new feature: .numberFormat (#13815)
	lib.myPrice = TEXT
	lib.myPrice {
		value = 0.8
		numberFormat {
			decimals = 2
			dec_point = ,
		}
		noTrimWrap = || $|
	}
	# Will result in "0,80 $"

	* GIFBUILDER has a new feature: ELLIPSE (#2049). Example:
	file  =  GIFBUILDER
	file  {
		XY  =  200,200
		format  =  jpg
		quality  =  100
		10  =  ELLIPSE
		10.dimensions  =  100,100,50,50
		10.color  =  red
	}


Database API / DBAL
===================

	* Prepared queries are now part of the TYPO3 database API (#15457).
	  The API is mostly based on PDO's method naming and currently
	  supports SELECT queries. TYPO3 will progressively use this new
	  database API which is cleaner and quicker when using DBAL.
	  Extension authors are encouraged to use it in their own
	  extensions.
	* Output of SQL parser when dealing with prepared queries is cached
	  for enhanced performances. To activate this caching if you don't have
	  a memcached server:
	  $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SYS']['useCachingFramework'] = 1;
	  In order to have a much higher cache hit ratio, you should use one
	  or more memcached servers. To activate this enhanced caching, use:
	  $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SYS']['useCachingFramework'] = 1;
	  $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SYS']['caching']['cacheConfigurations']['dbal'] = array(
	  	'backend' => 't3lib_cache_backend_MemcachedBackend',
		'options' => array(
	  		'servers' => array('localhost:11211', 'otherhost:11211'),
	  	)
	  );
	* DBAL now supports "FIND_IN_SET()" (#14818) function and maps it
	  correct functions in case usage under AdoDB. Using FIND_IN_SET in
	  listQuery() will provide performance improvements in all areas, as
	  this is used in several places (backend and frontend, for example
	  for checking the group list permissions).


Workspaces
==========

	* There is a new Scheduler task for the automatic publication of
	  workspaces (#14994).  If a publication date has been set for a
	  given workspace, it will be published the next time the Scheduler
	  task runs. Note that automatic "un-publication" still does not
	  work. Replaces non-working CLI script
	  "typo3/mod/user/ws/cli/ws_cli.phpsh".


Backend skin
============

	* sprites.css now contains the autogenerated sprites.


Speed improvements
==================

	* Added "compress data" options to DbBackend of the Caching
	  framework (#15141). Enable it like this:
	$TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SYS']['caching']['cacheConfigurations']['cache_pages'] =
	array(
		'frontend' => 't3lib_cache_frontend_VariableFrontend',
		'backend' => 't3lib_cache_backend_DbBackend',
		'options' => array(
			'cacheTable' => 'cachingframework_cache_pages',
			'tagsTable' => 'cachingframework_cache_pages_tags',
			'compression' => TRUE,
		),
	);
	* Some often used functions of t3lib_div were speed improved.
